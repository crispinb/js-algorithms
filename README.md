# JS Algorithms

Only for my own reviewing & adding to my limited algorithm & data structure knowledge (I
don't have a compsci background).

I wouldn't advise using this as any kind of reference. I'm not a javascript programmer, and
am only writing these as a quick more procedural contrast to the same algorithms written more
functionally in Elixir.
